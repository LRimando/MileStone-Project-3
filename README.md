# MileStone-Project-3

The inspiration of this simple application comes from the mere idea of being informed about the weather in your current city, a city you're planning to visit, or out of curiosity! It's always important to stay informed of the weather for plans or other events. The use of this weather application is made for our users to easily be notified of the current weather at any location you type in to the search bar. It is designed to have a dynamic background that changes in correlation to the location's temperature. 


## Technologies Used To Build Application

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. 

The database used to help create our weather app was retrieved from openweathermap.org. 

Google Fonts and background images found online were used to aid the weather app's design. 

Axios (Javascript Library) was used to help with the API from openweathermap, simplifying the process of requests and handling responses.
